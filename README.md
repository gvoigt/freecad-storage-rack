The kitchen FCMacro was only tested on FreeCAD version 0.15


The main file is kitchen.FCMacro which you have to call from within FreeCAD. It
is best to copy the code and paste it directly into the pyhton command line inside
FreeCAD. Make sure to change the pathes in kitchen.FCMacro to the respective directory of your repository.
